# Amplicon-Analysis-Pipeline

Amplicon DNA sequencing is a powerful tool for Microbial Ecology. However, there are various pipelines for data processing and analysis. To that end, this repository serves as a collection of tools and pipelines used by our lab. This includes tools for exploring microbial diversity through relative abundance, alpha/beta diversity, correlation networks, and others.
